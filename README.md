# RFID-Python-Attendence-System
This project is a smart Attendance Management System that uses RFID technology for student identification and a Python-based GUI for managing and recording attendance efficiently. Designed to streamline attendance processes in schools or colleges, it combines hardware and software for real-time tracking.

🔧 Features
🪪 RFID Integration: Uses RFID cards and Arduino to detect and identify students.

💻 Modern GUI: Built using CustomTkinter for a sleek, responsive desktop interface.

📊 Real-Time Attendance Recording: Automatically marks attendance upon RFID scan.

🧾 Excel Integration: Supports importing and exporting student data via Excel files.

⚙️ Admin Tools: Add, update, and manage student records with ease.

📡 Serial Communication: Connects with the RFID hardware via COM ports for live data.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (CustomTkinter for GUI, pandas for Excel handling)

Arduino UNO/Nano (with RFID module like RC522)

Serial Communication (pyserial)

Excel (xlsx/csv file support for bulk operations)

📌 Use Case
Perfect for educational institutions looking to automate and digitize their attendance system with minimal hardware.
